This is an Angular 2 helper module for developers who want to migrate their application from AngularJS to Angular 2.

I implemented an upgrade module to simplify the whole migration process and AngularJS dependencies, which we need during our upgrade phase to Angular 2. I already invested a lot of time to figure out how we can upgrade AngularJS dependencies to Angular 2, so this module can save you a lot of time.

```javascript
Put this upgrade folder into your src/app/shared/ folder
```

For more information how to upgrade to Angular 2 you can read my article here:
